This package was developed to assist in designing mechanisms involving linkages, cams, and gears. For linkages, it can
perform kinematic analysis by utilizing the degrees of freedom for the vectors that define the mechanism. Through
numerical solving and iteration, the position, velocity, and acceleration of these vectors and points can be determined.

For cams, the package provides the ability to generate cam profile coordinates, plot SVAJ (displacement, velocity,
acceleration, and jerk) diagrams, and create animations for cams with roller or flat-faced followers. These coordinates
can be used for machining or imported into SolidWorks. Users only need to specify the motion description (e.g., "rise 2
inches in 1 second, dwell for 1.5 seconds, fall 2 inches in 3 seconds"). Currently, the supported motion types include
uniform motion (not recommended for cam design), harmonic motion, and cycloidal motion. Future updates may introduce
improved options like modified sinusoidal motion.

For gears, the package can generate the coordinates of a spur gear tooth profile based on given properties such as
diametral pitch, number of teeth, or pitch diameter. If desired, an argument can be set to apply AGMA standards.

Install this package via pip: `pip install mechanism`. If you are interested in development, then do

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabemorris12/mechanism.git
cd mechanism
pip install -e .
```

# Running Animations in Jupyter Notebooks

The mechanism package now supports interactive animations in Jupyter notebooks, which enables the same interactive widget and real-time simulations as regualr .py files:


## Setup for Jupyter Notebook Animations

To run mechanism animations in Jupyter notebooks, you'll need to set up your environment with the required packages:

1. Create and activate a virtual environment, this is highly recommended:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
    What you should see after this point is a '''(.venv)''' at the beginning of your new terminal line

2. Install mechanism with notebook support:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[notebook]"  
   ```
    This includes ipympl for interactive plots

3. Install Jupyter:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter notebook
   ```
   This will install Jupyter frontend and Notebook within your virtual environment

4. Start Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Using Interactive Animations

In your Jupyter notebook, start with these imports and settings:

```python
%matplotlib ipympl  # Essential for interactive plots
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from mechanism import Mechanism, Joint, Vector
```

The `%matplotlib ipympl` magic command enables the interactive backend that allows for:
- Real-time animation updates
- Interactive zooming and panning
- Dynamic plot resizing
- Widget integration

It is essential that the `%matplotlib ipympl` magic command is before the '''import matplotlib.pyplot as plt'''

After completing the following, the animations should appear as interative inline elements!

## Example: Interactive Four-Bar Linkage

Here's a minimal example of an interactive animation in a Jupyter notebook:

```python
%matplotlib ipympl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from mechanism import Mechanism, Joint, Vector

# Define joints and vectors
O, A, B, C = get_joints('O A B C')
a = Vector((O, A), r=5)
b = Vector((A, B), r=8)
c = Vector((O, C), r=8, theta=0, style='ground')
d = Vector((C, B), r=9)

# Define motion
time = np.linspace(0, 0.12, 300)
angular_velocity = 50*np.pi/3  # 500 RPM
theta = angular_velocity*time
omega = np.full_like(time, angular_velocity)
alpha = np.zeros_like(time)

# Create and run mechanism
mechanism = Mechanism(
    vectors=(a, b, c, d),
    origin=O,
    loops=lambda x, i: a(i) + b(x[0]) - c() - d(x[1]),
    pos=theta,
    vel=omega,
    acc=alpha,
    guess=(np.deg2rad([45, 90]), [1000, 1000], [1000, 1000])
)

mechanism.iterate()
ani, fig, ax = mechanism.get_animation(show_joints=True)  # Enable joint labels
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **"Command not found: notebook"**: Make sure Jupyter is installed in your virtual environment
2. **"%matplotlib ipympl not working"**: Verify ipympl is installed with `pip list | grep ipympl`
3. **Kernel issues**: In Jupyter, go to Kernel â†’ Change kernel and select the kernel from your virtual environment
4. **Notebook not trusted**: Click the "Trust" button in the notebook interface

## Benefits of Jupyter Notebook Animations

- **Interactive Exploration**: Zoom, pan, and interact with the mechanism in real-time
- **Educational Value**: Combine animations with explanatory text and equations
- **Data Analysis**: Easily combine animations with data visualization
- **Documentation**: Create self-contained examples that others can run and modify

# Linkages, Cranks, Couplers, and Rockers

In order to use the contents of `mechanism.py`, a basic knowledge of vector loops must be known. The structure of the
vector loops function is shown in several files under the `examples` folder. To gain a greater understanding of this
package's usage, this walk through is provided.

## Four Bar Linkage Example

![image not found](https://github.com/gabemorris12/mechanism/raw/master/images/fourbarlinkage.PNG)

A four bar linkage is the basic building block of all mechanisms. This is similar to how the triangle is the basic
building block of all structures. What defines a mechanism or structure is the system's overall number of degrees of
freedom, and the number of degrees of freedom is determined via Kutzbach's equation.

![image not found](https://github.com/gabemorris12/mechanism/raw/master/images/fourbarlinkage_dof.PNG)

Kutzbach's equation is: *total degrees of freedom = 3(#links - 1) - 2(J1) - J2* where J1 is the number of full joints
(also known as a revolute joint) and J2 is the number of half joints. For this four bar linkage, there are 4 full
joints.

The number of degrees of freedom is: 3(4 - 1) - 2(4) = 1

This means that we need one known input to find the unknowns of the system. This can be explained further with a diagram
of the vectors that make up the four bar linkage.

![image not found](https://github.com/gabemorris12/mechanism/raw/master/images/fourbarlinkage_loop.PNG)

From the above image, the vector "a" is the crank. The speed at which it rotates will be considered as the input to the
system, and thus, it is the defining parameter to the system.

The lengths of all the vectors are known. The only two unknowns are the angle that corresponds to vector "b" and "d". It
is important to note that the objects that make up this package are vectors, and the polar form of the vectors is the
main interest.

There is only one loop equation which provides two equations when breaking down the vectors into its components. With
two equations and two unknowns, this system becomes solvable.

### Problem Statement

Consider the four bar linkage shown above. The lengths of a, b, c, and d are 5", 8", 8" and 9". The crank (a) rotates at
a constant 500 RPM. Use `mechanism` to get an animation of this linkage system and plot the angles, angular velocity,
and angular acceleration of vector d as a function of time.

### Solution

The four bar linkage is a grashof linkage because it satisfies the grashof condition (9 + 5 < 8 + 8). This means that
the crank is able to fully rotate. The input can be deduced by integrating and differentiating the constant value of the
constant angular velocity of the crank.

Always begin with defining the joints and vectors.

```python
from mechanism import *
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Declare the joints that make up the system.
O, A, B, C = get_joints('O A B C')

# Declare the vectors and keep in mind that angles are in radians and start from the positive x-axis.
a = Vector((O, A), r=5)
b = Vector((A, B), r=8)
c = Vector((O, C), r=8, theta=0, style='ground')
d = Vector((C, B), r=9)
```

Always define the vectors in the polar form. The first argument is the joints, and the first joint is the tail of the
vector, and the second is the head. Additionally, extra keyword arguments will be passed to plt.plot() for styling.

By not defining the angles for a vector (like `a`, `b`, and `c`) you are saying that this vector will have a varying
angle and the same is true for the length argument (`r`). If both the length and the angle are defined, as with `c`,
then the vector is stationary and will remain at this length and angle. If neither `r` or `theta` is specified, then you
are saying that the vector changes in length and angle, so you should expect two degrees of freedom for the input of
this vector in the vector loop equations. There should be half as many loop equations as there are unknown. The input
vector "a" does not need to have its known values at its declaration. Instead, it's values will be accounted for in the
loop equation. The next thing to do is to define the known input and guesses for the first iteration of the unknown
values.

```python
# Define the known input to the system.
# For a 500 RMP crank, the time it takes to rotate one rev is 0.12s
time = np.linspace(0, 0.12, 300)
angular_velocity = 50*np.pi/3  # This is 500 RPM in rad/s

theta = angular_velocity*time  # Integrate to find the theta
omega = np.full((time.size,), angular_velocity)  # Just an array of the same angular velocity
alpha = np.zeros(time.size)

# Guess the unknowns
pos_guess = np.deg2rad([45, 90])
vel_guess = np.array([1000, 1000])
acc_guess = np.array([1000, 1000])
```

The guess values need to be arrays of the same length as the number of unknowns. These arrays will be passed as the
first iteration. The next thing to do is to define the loop function and create the mechanism object.

```python
# Define the loop equation(s)
def loop(x, i):
    return a(i) + b(x[0]) - c() - d(x[1])


# Create the mechanism object
mechanism = Mechanism(vectors=(a, b, c, d), origin=O, loops=loop, pos=theta, vel=omega, acc=alpha,
                      guess=(pos_guess, vel_guess, acc_guess))
```

This example is simpler than most others because there is only one loop equation. For multiple loop equations, it is
important that the function returns a flattened array of the same length as there are unknown, and the indexing of the
first array argument to the loop corresponds to the input guess values. The second argument is the input. It is strongly
encouraged to view the examples for the more rigorous structure of the loop function. The last thing to do is to
call `mechanism.iterate()`, which is necessary if the input from `pos`, `vel`, and `acc` are arrays. If they are not
arrays, then it is assumed that the mechanism at an instant is desired. If this is the case, then
call `mechanism.calculate()` then call `mechanism.plot()` (see `plot_at_instant.py`).

```python
# Call mechanism.iterate() then get and show the animation
mechanism.iterate()
ani, fig_, ax_ = mechanism.get_animation()

# Plot the angles, angular velocity, and angular acceleration of vector d
fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=3, ncols=1)
ax[0].plot(time, d.pos.thetas, color='maroon')
ax[1].plot(time, d.vel.omegas, color='maroon')
ax[2].plot(time, d.acc.alphas, color='maroon')

ax[0].set_ylabel(r'$\theta$')
ax[1].set_ylabel(r'$\omega$')
ax[2].set_ylabel(r'$\alpha$')

ax[2].set_xlabel(r'Time (s)')
ax[0].set_title(r'Analysis of $\vec{d}$')

for a in (ax[0], ax[1], ax[2]):
    a.minorticks_on()
    a.grid(which='both')

fig.set_size_inches(7, 7)
# fig.savefig('../images/analysis_d.png')

plt.show()
```

# Cams

There are several kinds of motion types for a cam, but there is an important corollary when designing cams: *The jerk
function must be finite across the entire interval (360 degrees)* (Robert Norton's *Design of Machinery*). Usually, the
cycloidal motion type achieves this corollary, but it comes at a cost. It produces an acceleration and velocity that is
typically higher than the other motion types. More motion types are to come later (hopefully).

## Problem Statement

Design a cam using cycloidal motion that has the following motion description:

* Dwell at zero displacement for 90 degrees
* Rise 1 inch in 90 degrees
* Dwell for 90 degrees
* Fall 1 inch in 90 degrees

The cam's angular velocity is 2*pi radians per second. Show the SVAJ diagram as well as the cam's profile. Size the cam
for a roller follower with a radius of 1/2" with a maximum pressure angle of 30 degrees. Also size the cam for a flat
faced follower. Get an animation for both a roller/flat faced follower. Finally, save the coordinates of the profile to
a text file and show the steps for creating a part in SolidWorks.

## Solution

Begin by creating a cam object with the correct motion description.

```python
import numpy as np
from mechanism import Cam
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

cam = Cam(motion=[
    ('Dwell', 90),
    ('Rise', 1, 90),
    ('Dwell', 90),
    ('Fall', 1, 90)
], degrees=True, omega=2*np.pi)
```

The motion description is a list of tuples. Each tuple must contain 3 items for rising and falling and two items for
dwelling. The first item of the tuple is a string equal to "Rise", "Fall", or "Dwell" (not case-sensitive). For rise and
fall motion, the second item in the tuple is the distance at which the follower falls or rises. For dwelling, the second
item in the tuple is either the time (in seconds) or angle (in degrees) for which the displacement remains constant. The
third item in the tuple for rising and falling is equivalent to the second item for dwelling. If degrees is set to true,
then the last item in each tuple is interpreted as the angle for which the action occurs. A manual input for the angular
velocity is then required if conducting further analysis via SVAJ.

This is all that's required to call the following methods.

```python
fig1, ax1 = cam.plot(kind='all')
fig2, ax2 = cam.svaj(kind='cycloidal')
plt.show()
```

This produces the following:

![image not found](https://github.com/gabemorris12/mechanism/raw/master/images/displacement_plot.png)
![image not found](https://github.com/gabemorris12/mechanism/raw/master/images/svaj.png)

Looking at the acceleration plot, there are no vertical lines. This means that there is no infinite derivative at any
instant along the cam's profile; the jerk function is finite across each instant, making this an acceptable motion type.

If a roller follower with a 1/2" radius is desired, an analysis depending on the cam's radius of curvature and pressure
angle can be conducted to determine the base circle of the cam.

```python
roller_analysis = cam.get_base_circle(kind='cycloidal', follower='roller', roller_radius=1/2, max_pressure_angle=30,
                                      plot=True)
fig3, ax3 = cam.profile(kind='cycloidal', base=roller_analysis['Rb'], show_base=True, roller_radius=1/2,
                        show_pitch=True)
plt.show()
```

Output:

![image not found](https://github.com/gabemorris12/mechanism/raw/master/images/pressure_angle.png)
![image not found](https://github.com/gabemorris12/mechanism/raw/master/images/roller_profile.png)

For a flat faced follower, the radius of curvature at the point of contact should be positive (or greater than 0.25")
for all theta. There is an option to return the base radius such that the radius of curvature of the cam's profile is
positive for all values of theta (this is the conservative approach).

```python
flat_analysis = cam.get_base_circle(kind='cycloidal', follower='flat', desired_min_rho=0.25)
print(flat_analysis['Rb'])
print(flat_analysis['Min Face Width'])
fig4, ax4 = cam.profile(kind='cycloidal', base=flat_analysis['Rb'], show_base=True)
plt.show()
```

Output:

![image not found](https://github.com/gabemorris12/mechanism/raw/master/images/flat_profile.png)

The base circle radius was found to be 1.893" and the minimum face width for the follower was found to be 2.55".

To get the roller animation, call this:

```python
ani, fig5, ax5, follower = cam.get_animation(kind='cycloidal', base=roller_analysis['Rb'], roller_radius=1/2, length=2,
                                             width=3/8, inc=5)
fig6, ax6 = follower.plot()
plt.show()
```

Output:

![image not found](https://github.com/gabemorris12/mechanism/raw/master/images/cam_roller.gif)
![image not found](https://github.com/gabemorris12/mechanism/raw/master/images/roller_follower_displacement.png)

The graph above shows the actual follower displacement due to the circle having to always be tangent to the surface of
the cam. Note that as a result of this physical limitation, the follower will have higher magnitudes of velocity and
acceleration.

For the flat faced follower,

```python
ani_flat, fig7, ax7, follower = cam.get_animation(kind='cycloidal', base=flat_analysis['Rb'], face_width=2.75, length=2,
                                                  width=3/8, inc=5)
fig8, ax8 = follower.plot()
plt.show()
```

Output:

![image not found](https://github.com/gabemorris12/mechanism/raw/master/images/flat_follower_displacement.png)

### Getting Coordinates into SolidWorks

Save the coordinates to a text file.

```python
cam.save_coordinates('cam_coordinates.txt', kind='cycloidal', base=1.3, solidworks=True)
```

Select `Curve Through XYZ Points`

![image not found](https://github.com/gabemorris12/mechanism/raw/master/images/curve_xyz.png)

The cam profile will always be extended to the front plane due to the manner in which SolidWorks defines the global
coordinates. Next, select browse and choose the saved coordinate file, making sure that text files are able to be seen.

![image not found](https://github.com/gabemorris12/mechanism/raw/master/images/select_file.PNG)

Create a sketch on the front plane. Select the curve and then convert entities. The sketch is now projected to the front
plane.

![image not found](https://github.com/gabemorris12/mechanism/raw/master/images/front_plane.PNG)

Notice that the sketch is not closed. Add a line to close the sketch, then extrude the sketch.

# Gears

To use this feature, a knowledge of gear nomenclature must be known. Here is a figure from Robert Norton's *Design of
Machinery*:

![image not found](https://github.com/gabemorris12/mechanism/raw/master/images/gear_nomenclature.PNG)

For gears, a general rule of thumb is that the base circle must fall below the dedendum circle because the curve below
base circle cannot be an involute curve. This package will send a warning if this occurs, and if it is desired to
continue, the curve below the circle is just a straight line, and undercutting will occur.

For a reference, here are the AGMA (American Gear Manufacturers Association) standards from *Design of Machinery*:

![image not found](https://github.com/gabemorris12/mechanism/raw/master/images/agma.PNG)

## Problem Statement

Design a gear that has a diametral pitch of 32 and has 60 teeth using `mechanism`. The gear follows the AGMA standards.
Compare the gear to SolidWorks' gear from the tool library.

## Solution

Define a gear object with the known information and save the coordinates to a file.

```python
from mechanism import SpurGear
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

gear = SpurGear(N=60, pd=32, agma=True, size=500)
fig, ax = gear.plot()
fig.savefig('../images/gear60.PNG', dpi=240)
plt.show()
gear.save_coordinates(file='gear_tooth_coordinates.txt', solidworks=True)
gear.rundown()
```

output:

![image not found](https://github.com/gabemorris12/mechanism/raw/master/images/gear60.PNG)

| Property                 | Value    |
|--------------------------|----------|
| Number of Teeth (N)      | 60       |
| Diametral Pitch (pd)     | 32.00000 |
| Pitch Diameter (d)       | 1.87500  |
| Pitch Radius (r)         | 0.93750  |
| Pressure Angle (phi)     | 20.00000 |
| Base Radius              | 0.88096  |
| Addendum (a)             | 0.03125  |
| Dedendum (b)             | 0.03906  |
| Circular Tooth Thickness | 0.04846  |
| Circular Space Width     | 0.04971  |
| Circular Backlash        | 0.00125  |

Keep in mind that the `size` argument refers to the size of the coordinates that make up the involute curve. The more
points, the sharper it is, but SolidWorks sometimes struggles with points being too close together. If SolidWorks fails
to generate the curve, then decrease the size. The default value is 300.

### SolidWorks Results

Follow the same steps to get the curve into SolidWorks from the cam example. Make sure that the units in SolidWorks
matches the units of the analysis.

![image not found](https://github.com/gabemorris12/mechanism/raw/master/images/gear60_compare.PNG)

The results are a near identical match, and the addendum and dedendum fit perfectly. If analyzed closely, the only
difference is the tooth thickness. The gray gear (the resulting gear from this package) has a slightly larger tooth
thickness compared to SolidWorks' gear. This is due to the fact that SolidWorks doesn't use an involute gear tooth
profile, as gears from the SolidWorks toolbox are for visuals only. Instead, the tooth profile is circular. Their gears
should not be used for manufacturing as this is not accurate at all. The purpose of the involute tooth profile is that
the meshing of gears will always produce a constant angular velocity, even when the gears aren't perfectly placed
tangent to the pitch circles.
